# Robotic Bin Picking

During 2009-2015, I worked a lot on the robot bin-picking problem where the goal is to enable a robot the capability of knowing the 6D poses of the parts in an accuracy so that the robot can pick a desired part up and assemble it into another biger part. Over the years, we have developed several object pose estimation algorithms including the fast directional chamfer matching and the learning to vote algorithm. Our team successfully pushed our research results into a commerical product (Mitsubishi Electric MELFA-3D system). We are honored that R&D Magazine recognized our innovation and gave the R&D 100 award in 2014.
